# apache-kafka community

Welcome to apache-kafka community docs.

This will be a resource for all who land on these shores to find and enjoy the bounty of combining [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) with [Python](https://www.python.org/).

## Kafka, a brief history

Apache Kafka is an open-source stream-processing software platform developed by LinkedIn and donated to the Apache Software Foundation, written in Scala and Java. Here's a brief history:

**2010**: Kafka was originally developed at LinkedIn to handle the company's activity stream data and operational metrics.

**2011**: Kafka was open-sourced and became an Apache Incubator project.

**2012**: Kafka graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a top-level project.

**2014**: The introduction of Kafka 0.8 brought significant improvements, including replication.

**2015**: Confluent, a company founded by the original creators of Kafka, was established to provide commercial support and additional tools for Kafka.

**2016**: Kafka Streams, a stream processing library, was introduced.

**2017**: Kafka Connect, a framework for connecting Kafka with external systems, was introduced.

**2018**: The release of Kafka 2.0 included major improvements in performance and scalability.

**2020s**: Kafka continues to evolve with enhancements in security, performance, and new features like tiered storage.

Kafka is now widely used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications, known for its high throughput, scalability, and fault tolerance.

## Python, a brief history

**Late 1980s**: Python was conceived by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language.

**1991**: The first version of Python (0.9.0) was released. It included features like exception handling, functions, and the core data types: list, dict, str, etc.

**1994**: Python 1.0 was released, introducing new features such as lambda, map, filter, and reduce.

**2000**: Python 2.0 was released, adding list comprehensions, garbage collection, and support for Unicode.

**2001**: The Python Software Foundation (PSF) was formed to manage the development of Python.

**2008**: Python 3.0 was released, a major revision that was not backward-compatible with Python 2.x. It introduced many changes to improve the language's consistency and eliminate redundancy.

**2010s**: Python's popularity surged, driven by its simplicity and the rise of data science, machine learning, and web development.

**2020**: Python 2 reached its end of life, with Python 3 becoming the standard.

**Present**: Python continues to evolve with regular updates, maintaining its status as one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

Python is known for its readability, simplicity, and versatility, making it a favorite among beginners and experienced developers alike.
